# Weather
#The primary objective of this project was to create a user-friendly web application that provides real-time weather forecast based on user input. To accomplish this, I employed a tech stack that includes HTML for structuring the content and layout, CSS for styling and design, and JavaScript for interactive functionality. Bootstrap was used for a responsive design, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices. Additionally, I integrated a weather API from Rapid API to fetch accurate and up-to-date weather data.
User interaction is a key aspect of the application. Users can input their desired location into the search bar, and upon submission, the application fetches the corresponding weather data and updates the display accordingly. This allows users to quickly and easily access weather information for their preferred locations
